			<p> From 1950 until now, there has been a rapid increase in plastic production. Studies
show that of the 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic produced in the world, 6.3 billion
metric tons become waste. Of that amount, only 9% has been recycled, leaving the
remaining 91% to accumulate in landfills and the natural environment. The company
called Repo, founded by Binghamton University students, is the first national recycled
coin system to repurpose plastic waste. Repo’s business plan is simple: collect,
burn, and distribute to currencies. The company partners with waste management
and incinerator services who, depending on the project, are either subsidized by
a central bank or by Repo’s investors. These companies go out and collect trash
from landfills and the natural environment, for example streets, beaches, oceans, and
forests. After the trash is collected, the plastic is separated and then melted down to become the base material for a currency.</p>
<p>Once Repo is adopted as the official material for a currency, the company ensures
rapid change-over from the old material to the new plastic. Additionally, the new
plastic currency system is semantically identical to the paper/metal system that the
bank previously occupied. Once the job is complete, Repo’s commitment to zero
waste does not end. Any left over garbage, coin, or dollar from the project is melted
down and turned into eco-friendly products that are distributed in the countries that
adopt Repo. </p>
